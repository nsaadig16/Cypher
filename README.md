# Cypher: A Valorant Discord Bot

Cypher is a Valorant Discord bot that shows you information on any player as well as a match leaderboard.

## Use

To host this bot yourself, you will need to create an application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and get a [HenrikDev API key](https://api.henrikdev.xyz/dashboard/).

Place your bot's `TOKEN` and your `API_KEY` in an environment file as shown in `.env.example`.

You then can start it by running `docker compose up` on the root folder.
